# User-based-recommendation-model-for-Amazon
Analysis Task
	<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis:</h3>
*	Which movies have maximum views/ratings?
*	What is the average rating for each movie? Define the top 5 movies with the maximum ratings.
*	Define the top 5 movies with the least audience.
<h3>	Recommendation Model: </h3>
* Some of the movies hadnâ€™t been watched and therefore, are not rated by the users. Netflix would like to take this as an opportunity and build a machine learning         recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users.
* Divide the data into training and test data
* Build a recommendation model on training data
* Make predictions on the test data
